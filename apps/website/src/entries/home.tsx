        The generated project is intentionally small. You own the render loop, scene transitions, gameplay systems, and how much of the stack you keep or replace.

    <Section
      intro="BLUD is not trying to be an everything-engine. The runtime boundary stays in your app, while the tools produce content and helper packages you can compose around it."
      title="What ships with the framework"
    >
      <ul>
        <li>The CLI starter gives you a real project structure, not a throwaway sample.</li>
        <li>Blob focuses on world authoring and runtime exports for your game.</li>
        <li>Animation Studio exports animation bundles and graphs that your gameplay code can load and drive.</li>
        <li>You still own the camera, controls, render loop, scene lifecycle, and gameplay systems.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That division matters. It keeps the framework useful without turning your project into a hard-to-untangle editor runtime.

      intro="This needs to be said plainly because it changes how you should evaluate the framework today."
      title="Treat it as experimental software"
    >
      <p>
        BLUD is in an extremely experimental public preview. Expect APIs, generated project structure, runtime contracts, and editor workflows to change. Expect rough edges. Expect breakage.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you adopt it now, do it because you want to move quickly and you are comfortable working with a changing toolchain. If you need long-term stability today, this is too early.
