        The generated starter currently targets the vanilla Three.js runtime workflow. That means you get a lightweight app shell instead of a hidden engine layer.

      <p>
        If you generated the project with another package manager, use that manager for install and scripts instead. The starter README mirrors those commands.

        Start with <code className="rounded bg-white/8 px-2 py-1 text-sm text-white">bun run dev</code>, move around in the included scene, then swap in your own exported runtime scene and assets.

        The next page covers the generated folder structure in detail so you know where scenes, gameplay code, and animation bundles belong.
