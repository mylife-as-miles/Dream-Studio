        Once dependencies are installed, you can launch either editor independently. GitHub Pages only hosts the static website build, not the local editor server features.

        The root <code className="rounded bg-white/8 px-2 py-1 text-sm text-white">dev</code> script currently targets Blob, so the short command is fine if you are working from the monorepo root.

        Use the animation editor when you want to export graph and bundle artifacts into your game project. The scaffolded app already has a place for those exports under <code className="rounded bg-white/8 px-2 py-1 text-sm text-white">src/animations</code>.
